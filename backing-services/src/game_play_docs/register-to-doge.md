## Register to Doge

Your team consists of people from different job roles and skill sets. We recommend that you start the day by discussing each others strengths and considering where you each can best help. Alongside the technical aspects of the incident you should also consider what important roles your non-technical team members can fill, for example:

- Comms
- User impact
- Incident management

(use the _Teams_ link above to find out your team information)
