## Register to Doge / Service Manual

### Application

The application source code is available here: <https://github.com/tlwr/register-a-doge> üê∂

Register to Doge is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) (v2.6.3) with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) - a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for writing web applications.
The database engine is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

----

### Hosting

#### AWS

Amazon Web Service (cloud provider) is used to host the application in a **single** EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance.

SSM (Simple Systems Manager) Session Manager is used to access the instance.

The database is hosted on RDS (Relational Database Service), an AWS service that manages underlying infrastructure and provides access to a database.

CloudWatch provides log visibility.

There is no infrastructure-as-code set up - building of the instance is done using **Cloud-Init** (user-data) - see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) for details.
