## Register to Doge / Tasks

You are a multidisciplinary service team who have just inherited a legacy service called “Register a Doge”, as Shiba Inus 🐶 are now a restricted animal. After a quick-and-dirty migration the service was moved into AWS (region _eu-west-2_).

There is little documentation for how this works 😞 and there is no infrastructure-as-code set up for this application. The only record of how the machine was built is the **Cloud-Init** (user-data).

First, you must familiarise yourself with the application, ensure you can:

- **Log in** to the AWS account
- **Gain SSH access** to the box using AWS SSM Session Manager
- **Access the database** from your local machine using credentials obtained from the instance (don’t lose these)
- **See logs and metrics** using AWS CloudWatch Logs and AWS CloudWatch Metrics

See the [Service Manual](/docs/register-to-doge-sm) for some more information on the deployment.

### Scoreboard

This exercise is designed to promote cross-team working, raise awareness of each other's roles within GDS and the incident handling procedures 😎  
However, to add some tension there's a competition element! See [here](/scoreboard) for the scoreboard 📈

----

### Time
You have until **2pm**. During the day there will be a need to complete incident report(s) - see the [Service Manual](/docs/register-to-doge-sm) for incident handling details.  

At 2pm we will reconvene in the Garage to review how all the teams got on.

Make sure you have a lunch break at some point, you may want to ensure your whole team doesn’t go at the same time - you never know what problems may crop up...
